# Modifier in C Language
- The amount of memory space to be allocated for a variable is derived by modifiers.
- Modifiers are prefixed with basic data types to modify (either increase or decrease) the amount of storage space allocated to a variable.
- For example, storage space for the `int` data type is 4 byte for a 32 bit processor.
- Increasing the range is done so by using `long int` which is 8 byte.
- Decrease the range by using a `short int` which is 2 byte.

These are the five modifiers available in C language:
1. `short`
2. `long`
3. `signed`
4. `unsigned`
5. `long long`

**Please keep in mind that storage size and range for `int` and `float` datatype will vary depend on the CPU processor (8,16, 32 and 64 bit)**
