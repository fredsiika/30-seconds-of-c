# Introduction: Getting Started With C Programming

## C is a language for small, fast programs.
The C language is designed to create small, fast programs. It’s
lower-level than most other languages; that means it creates code
that’s a lot closer to what machines really understand.

### The Process
**1. Create Source:**
First step is to create a source file which contains human-readable code in C.

**2. Compile Source:**
Next step is to run your source file through a `compiler`. The compiler is responsible for converting your C code into machine code. This process is necessary becuase computers only understand one language: **machine code,** which is a binary stream of 0s and 1s.

**3. Output Executable:**
A new file called an **executable** is created once the source file has successfully compiled. This file is the program you will run. This is because it contains the stream of 0s and 1s **machine code** that te computer can understand.
