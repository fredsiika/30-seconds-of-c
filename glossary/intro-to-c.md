# Introduction: Getting Started With C Programming

## C is a language for small, fast programs.
The C language is designed to create small, fast programs. It’s
lower-level than most other languages; that means it creates code
that’s a lot closer to what machines really understand.

### The Process
**1. Create Source:**
First step is to create a source file which contains human-readable code in C.

**2. Compile Source:**
Next step is to run your source file through a `compiler`. The compiler is responsible for converting your C code into machine code. This process is necessary becuase computers only understand one language: **machine code,** which is a binary stream of 0s and 1s.

**3. Output Executable:**
A new file called an **executable** is created once the source file has successfully compiled. This file is the program you will run. This is because it contains the stream of 0s and 1s **machine code** that te computer can understand.

### Conclusion
- Most operating systems are written in C. 
- C is used where speed, space, and portability are important. 
- Most other computer languages are also written in C. 
- And most game software is written in C.

There are three C standards that you may
stumble across. ANSI C is from the late 1980s
and is used for the oldest code. A lot of things
were ixed up in the C99 standard from 1999. And
some cool new language features were added in
the current standard, C11, released in 2011. The
differences between the different versions aren’t
huge, and we’ll point them out along the way.
